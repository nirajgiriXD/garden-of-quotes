- Brach name should not contain any capital letter.
- For adding feature, the branch name should start with `feat/` followed by the feature name.
- For fixing issue, the branch name should start with `fix/` followd by the issue name.
- The `main` branch is protected, so PR has to created which has to be reviewed and approved by a reviewer before merging into the `main` branch.
